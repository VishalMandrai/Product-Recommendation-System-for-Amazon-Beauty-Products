<p><h4> The below recommendation system is based on the journey of a new customer from the time he/she lands on the business’s website for the first time to the time when he/she makes repeat purchases.</h4></p>
  
### The recommendation system is designed in 2 parts based on the business requirement:
<ul>
<li><p><b>Recommendation system part 1:</b> Product popularity-based system targeted at new customers. These kinds of systems provide great strategy to target the new customers with the most popular products sold on a business's website and is very useful to start a recommendation engine.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Recommendation system part 2:</b> Model-based collaborative filtering system based on customer's purchase history and ratings provided by other users who also bought similar items.</p></li>
</ul>

### What Is Collaborative Filtering?
<p><h4> Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user.</h4></p>
